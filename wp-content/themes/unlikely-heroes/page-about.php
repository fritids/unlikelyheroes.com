				<p class="lead">Unlikely Heroes is named after a company of people across the globe who refuse to leave 27 million people trapped in sex slavery. They are heroes not because the masses know their name, but because they’re willing to take up the fight.</p>
				<p class="lead">While some build restoration homes, others use their gifts to start campaigns or spread awareness. But none of us are willing to sit on the sidelines and do nothing.</p>
				<p class="lead">Unlikely Heroes also refers to children who have been and are about to be rescued. Almost all our rescued child victims want to share their stories to help stop the trafficking cycle. They might be the heroes most of all.</p>

					<div class="team-member-position">President &amp; Founder, Master of Social Welfare</div>
					<p>Erica Greve has been trying to save the world since the 9th grade. Her life calling to social activism officially began when she refused to dissect animals in school, and she later graduated with her Master’s degree in Social Welfare from UC Berkeley in 2008.</p>
					<p>As the president and founder, Erica oversees all departments and is a strong team builder. Having provided years of crisis counseling and support to victims of sexual and physical abuse through children’s hospitals and emergency units, her background in social services includes both clinical and practical training. This has allowed her to restore child victims of sex slavery in a long-standing way and begin to raise the standards of restorative care in the Philippines and around the world.</p>
					<p>Although she eats almost all exclusively pre-made meals, she’s a spectacular chef and makes a mean spinach avocado soup. </p>
